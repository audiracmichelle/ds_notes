## Cultural

1. Which data scientists do you admire most? Which startups?

I would go for the classical data scientists like Leo Breiman and Jerome Friedman. Leo being the creator of random trees. I once read a small biography on Leo and I admire how he stood up to criticism because he started doing things differently and challenging the traditional statistical community. I don't know a lot about Friedman but the reason I choose him is because he contributed to the creation gradient boosting and also one of the authors of the Bible of statisticians and machine learners "the elements of statistics". 
My favorite startups: coursera and duolingo...which remind me of another good data scientist, Andrew Ng

2. What do you think makes a good data scientist?

Working with data is a humbling experience...
Don't kill ants with tanks, proper tools, break up the problems
Don't blame things on "the data" 

4. How did you become interested in data science?

Honestly, since 2nd grade my favorite homework were the math word problems so I would say that I have always find it very fascinating to think of ways to plug in numbers to an applied problem. But seriously, when I was looking for my first job I knew I wanted it to be a position where I could code and do modeling in a business setting. At that time, those positions were not as common as they are today, at least in Mexico, most analysts would work on spreadsheets and the most sophisticated people would have to pay for a license to use sas.

5. Give a few examples of “best practices” in data science.

That can be answered from several angles right? 
  - from the modeling perspective: provide a baseline model and performance metrics, don't jump into the most complex model, feature engineering is the key
  - from a business perspective: break up the problem into pieces, make sure that your solution properly solves a problem, understand the trade-offs of different solutions
  - from a coding perspective: document your changes, properly use versioning control tools, avoid cryptic variable names 

6. What is the latest data science book / article you read? What is the latest data mining conference / webinar / class / workshop / training you attended?
  - udacity
  - neo4j nodes
  - cover-19

7. What’s a project you would want to work on at our company?

11. Have you ever thought about creating your own startup? Around which idea / concept?

12. What can your hobbies tell me that your resume can’t?
I recently acquired two new hobby, planting herbs and making bread

13. What are your top 5 predictions for the next 20 years?
Uuuhhh it's not too positive

14. What did you do today? Or what did you do this week / last week?
Following the daily morning conversations of the UT consortium for cover research and reading about statistical models that would could provide a guideline on how to relax social distancing properly

15. If you won a million dollars in the lottery, what would you do with the money?
It's not a huge amount of money. As I worked in an asset mgmt team and enjoy creating my own investment models I would put a portion in the markets. I also collect start up pitches, every time I have an idea that sounds good I try to write it down, so I would look for those notes and figure out which one to fund
