Don't be afraid of not knowing the answer to questions, try to focus on showing that you are a professional person capable of figuring out ways to solve a problem. "It would probably be good to think about", "it appears that". Break down the question, give estimates. Highlight things that you do know.

Make sure to involve the other person in every single part of the interview. Pace yourself, ask "does that make sense?", "am I making any sense here?" or "I didn't think that far yet", "that is certainly true!", "feel free to slow me down". 

Try to soft land your answers with words like "along those lines","potentially", "presumably","when you think of","sort of","if all we are interested in". 

If you happen to know a lot about a subject, take the chance! "Let me breeze through some of the basic concepts","for a more complete picture"

Be extremely polite, say "please do" "I'll give it over to you", "feel free to interrupt me".

To close the interview prepare lines that summarize your skills and that reflect your interest in the job.

Drink water, that will remind you that you are human.

Prepare a list of thing you are interested in:
+ knowledge graph
+ crowd sourcing
+ graph based algorithms
+ recommendation systems
+ fraud ring detection

Questions:
How does a typical day in Apple's Data Strategic Solutions team look like? 
What are the projects that you have worked on that you like the most? 
What are the type of projects that you have enjoyed the most?

I am:
I feel nervous when I'm waiting to see the performance metrics of a new model 
And a rush of adrenaline when I'm testing a new feature.
I find it so exciting to
Take ownership, accountable, transparent 
I know I take real ownership of the projects I have worked on and care deeply about those projects. I enjoy thinking how to perfect things, how to make things better more efficient and more intuitive and more simple, so I want to work in a place that also does.  

I think that the quality of the products and services of a company tell a lot about the people and teams behind them. They might tell you a little bit about the talent of the people in the teams, but most importantly how well they work together and what they care about. to learn more the values of a company, instead of looking at their mission and vision statements, I would probably be try at their actual products and services first. Just by looking at Apple's products I can say that teams at Apple are incredibly creative, they put a lot of attention to detail and really care about making reliable products. 




Visualization Encantation:

What can go wrong?
+ Interviewers look bored, deceived -> don't let them bring you down, keep the high energy
+ you don't know the answer to the question -> remember that this is not a knowledge standardized test.
+ First interviews go wrong -> so your energy goes down
